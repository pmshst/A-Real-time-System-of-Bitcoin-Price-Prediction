This report is about a real-time system of Bitcoin price prediction using some big data technologies, including the implementation of data collecting, data preprocessing, modelling, trading strategy, real-time prediction and visualization of the predicted results. The main method of this system is from the paper published by MIT Professor Shah in Oct 2014 [9], which is bayesian regression.




bitcoin_price_prediction.ipynb is used to train the model and save the parameters
get_data_from_okcoin.py is used to collect data from okcoin.com in real time
real_time_prediction.py is used to predict the Bitcoin price in real time by the model trained i.e. the parameters
