This project is about a real-time system of Bitcoin price prediction using some big data technologies, 
including the implementation of data collecting, data preprocessing, modelling, trading strategy, 
real-time prediction and visualization of the predicted results. 
The main method of this system is from the paper published by MIT Professor Shah 
in Oct 2014 [9] Devavrat Shah, Kang Zhang Bayesian regression and Bitcoin https://arxiv.org/abs/1410.1231 
which is bayesian regression.


bitcoin_price_prediction.ipynb is used to train the model and save the parameters
get_data_from_okcoin.py is used to collect data from okcoin.com in real time
real_time_prediction.py is used to predict the Bitcoin price in real time by the model trained i.e. the parameters
